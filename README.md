# Advanced Secured Vault with Multi-Layered Security and Cloud Backup

Advanced Secured Vault with Multi-Layered Security and Cloud Backup is a defense-in-depth based secure storage system that integrates multi-factor authentication, AES client-side encryption, RSA/ECC-based secure key management, integrity verification, role-based access control, audit logging, and encrypted cloud backup to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data.



## Key Features

-  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
-  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
-  **AES Client-Side File Encryption**
-  **RSA/ECC Secure Key Management**
-  **SHA-256 File Integrity Verification**
-  **End-to-End Encrypted Cloud Backup**
-  **Audit Logging & Monitoring**
-  **Secure Disaster Recovery**



##  Architecture

The system follows a **client-side encryption model**, meaning:

- Files are encrypted before storage
- Cloud providers never access plaintext data
- Each file uses a unique symmetric key
- Keys are protected using asymmetric cryptography

This layered architecture ensures that even if one security layer is compromised, the entire system remains protected.



##  Security Highlights

- Isolated file-level encryption
- Tamper detection using hash verification
- Protection against brute-force and replay attacks
- Secure key exchange mechanisms
- Encrypted cloud synchronization
- Append-only audit logs for accountability



##  Performance

- AES encryption shows efficient, scalable performance
- MFA introduces minimal authentication delay
- Cloud backup has low network overhead
- Strong balance between security and usability



##  Objective

To design a secure, scalable, and reliable file vault system that protects sensitive data using a comprehensive multi-layered security framework instead of relying on single-point protection.
